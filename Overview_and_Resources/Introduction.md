* A script is command line program that contains a series of commands.<br>
* Commands contained in a script are executed by an interpreter. In case of shell scripts, the shell acts  as the interpreter and executes the commands one after the other.

      ```console
      #!/bin/bash
      echo "Scripting is fun!!!"
      ```
