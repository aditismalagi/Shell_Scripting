### Reading A File Line-by-Line
* To read a file line by line a while loop in conjunction with the read command can be used. On the last line of the while loop the keyword *done* is followed by a less than sign followed by the file to be read.
#### Example:
```bash
LINE_NUM=1
while [[ read LINE ]]
do
  echo "${LINE_NUM} : ${LINE}"
  ((LINE_NUM++))
done < /Damon_Salvatore
```
### Break and Continue
* To exit a loop before its normal ending; the ***break*** statement is used. *Break* statement exits the loop but not the script, the script will continue after the loop.
#### Example:
```bash
while [[ TRUE ]]
do
  read -p "1. Show Disk Usage. 2. Show uptime." CHOICE
  case $CHOICE in
    1)
      df -h
      ;;
    2)
      uptime
      ;;
    *)
      break
      ;;
  esac
done
```
* To restart the loop at the next iteration before the loop completes use the ***continue*** statement. Any commands that follow the *continue* statement in the loop will not be executed. Execution continues back at the top of the loop and the while condition is examined again.
#### Example:
```bash
mysql -BNe 'show databases' | while [[ read DB ]]
do
  db-backed-up-recently $DB             # Not an actual command
  if [[ "$?" -eq "0" ]]
  then
    continue
  fi
  backup $DB                           # Not an actual command
done
```
